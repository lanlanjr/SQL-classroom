# SQL Classroom Security Enhancement: DQL-Only Restrictions

## Summary of Changes

This document outlines the comprehensive security enhancement implemented to restrict SQL Classroom users (both teachers and students) to only Data Query Language (DQL) operations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Validation Utility (`app/utils.py`)

**New file**: `app/utils.py`
- **Function**: `validate_dql_only_query(query)`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive validation to ensure only DQL operations are allowed
- **Restrictions implemented**:
  - **Allowed**: SELECT, SHOW TABLES, SHOW COLUMNS, SHOW DATABASES, DESCRIBE, EXPLAIN, SHOW CREATE TABLE, SHOW INDEX
  - **Forbidden**: 
    - DDL (Data Definition Language): CREATE, DROP, ALTER, TRUNCATE, RENAME
    - DML (Data Manipulation Language): INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, REPLACE, MERGE
    - DCL (Data Control Language): GRANT, REVOKE, DENY
    - TCL (Transaction Control Language): COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT, BEGIN, START TRANSACTION
    - Administrative commands: USE, SET, FLUSH, KILL, SHUTDOWN
    - File operations: INTO OUTFILE, LOAD DATA, LOAD_FILE
    - Stored procedures/functions: PROCEDURE, FUNCTION, TRIGGER, CALL
    - SQL comments: --, #, /* */
    - Multiple statements (semicolon injection prevention)
    - System schema access: INFORMATION_SCHEMA, mysql, sys

### 2. Updated Student Route Validation (`app/routes/student.py`)

**Modified function**: `validate_student_query(query)`
- Replaced with a wrapper that calls the new `validate_dql_only_query()` function
- Maintains backward compatibility while using the enhanced validation

**Applied to endpoints**:
- `/api/execute-query` (assignment question execution)
- `/api/playground-execute` (student SQL playground)

### 3. Updated Teacher Route Validation (`app/routes/teacher.py`)

**Modified endpoints**:
- `/api/playground-execute` (teacher SQL playground)
- `/api/preview-question` (question preview during creation/editing)

**Key changes**:
- Added `validate_dql_only_query()` validation to teacher routes
- Teachers now have the same restrictions as students for security

### 4. Updated User Interface Templates

**Student SQL Playground** (`app/templates/student/sql_playground.html`):
- Updated help text to reflect DQL-only restrictions
- Enhanced tips section with comprehensive information about allowed operations

**Teacher SQL Playground** (`app/templates/teacher/sql_playground.html`):
- Removed DDL/DML template buttons (CREATE TABLE, INSERT)
- Updated help text to inform teachers about security restrictions
- Added security notice about DQL-only operations
- Changed "Teacher SQL Reference" to "SQL Query Reference"

### 5. Updated Documentation (`README.md`)

**Enhanced sections**:
- **Recent Improvements**: Added comprehensive DQL-only restrictions information
- **Security Considerations**: Detailed explanation of query restrictions and security measures

### 6. Created Test Suite (`tests/test_dql_validation.py`)

**Test coverage**:
- Valid DQL queries (SELECT, SHOW, DESCRIBE, EXPLAIN)
- Invalid DDL queries (CREATE, DROP, ALTER)
- Invalid DML queries (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) 
- Invalid DCL queries (GRANT, REVOKE)
- Invalid TCL queries (COMMIT, ROLLBACK)
- Edge cases (empty queries, comments, multiple statements)

## Security Benefits

### Before Changes
- Students: Limited restrictions, mainly basic keyword filtering
- Teachers: Full SQL access including DDL, DML, DCL operations
- Risk: Potential database modification, data corruption, security breaches

### After Changes
- **Students**: Comprehensive DQL-only restrictions
- **Teachers**: Same DQL-only restrictions for consistency and security
- **Eliminated risks**:
  - Database structure modification (CREATE, DROP, ALTER)
  - Data manipulation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
  - Permission changes (GRANT, REVOKE)
  - Transaction control bypass
  - File system access
  - System schema information disclosure
  - SQL injection through comments or multiple statements

## Affected User Experience

### For Students
- **No change** in legitimate use cases (learning SQL SELECT queries)
- **Enhanced security** with clear error messages about forbidden operations
- **Better guidance** with updated UI text explaining allowed operations

### For Teachers
- **Restricted** from DDL/DML operations in playground and question preview
- **Maintains** ability to create questions with sample schemas (via schema import feature)
- **Enhanced security** prevents accidental database modifications
- **Clear messaging** about security restrictions

## Backward Compatibility

- **Existing questions**: No impact on existing assignment questions
- **Database schemas**: Schema import functionality remains intact
- **User accounts**: No changes to user authentication or authorization
- **API endpoints**: Same endpoint URLs, enhanced validation only

## Testing Validation

The implementation has been validated with comprehensive testing:
- ✅ Valid SELECT queries pass validation
- ✅ Valid information queries (SHOW, DESCRIBE) pass validation  
- ✅ All DDL operations are blocked
- ✅ All DML operations are blocked
- ✅ All DCL operations are blocked
- ✅ All TCL operations are blocked
- ✅ File operations are blocked
- ✅ SQL injection attempts are blocked
- ✅ System schema access is restricted

## Implementation Status

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

All changes have been implemented and tested. The SQL Classroom application now enforces strict DQL-only restrictions for both teachers and students, significantly enhancing the security posture while maintaining the core educational functionality.
