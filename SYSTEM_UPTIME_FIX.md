# System Uptime Fix Summary

## Problem
The uptime display in the admin system page was showing time since page load instead of actual application uptime, starting from when the page was loaded rather than when the Flask application started.

## Root Cause
The JavaScript was using `new Date()` as the start time, which resets every time the page is loaded or refreshed, not reflecting the actual system start time.

## Solution

### 1. Server-Side Tracking (admin.py)
- Added `app_start_time` global variable to track when the admin module loads
- Enhanced `system_info()` function to calculate real uptime
- Added uptime data to template context:
  - `app_start_time`: When the application started
  - `uptime_hours`: Current uptime in hours
  - `uptime_minutes`: Current uptime in minutes  
  - `uptime_display`: Formatted uptime string

### 2. Template Updates (system.html)
- Updated uptime card to show actual uptime from server
- Added application start time display below uptime
- Enhanced Application Information table with:
  - Application Started timestamp
  - Current Uptime display

### 3. JavaScript Enhancement
- Uses server-provided start time as baseline
- Calculates additional time since page load
- Updates display every minute with accurate increments
- No longer resets on page refresh

## Features Added

### Uptime Card Display:
- Shows actual uptime (e.g., "2h 45m")
- Shows start timestamp below (e.g., "Since 2025-07-26 14:30 UTC")

### Application Information Table:
- **Application Started**: Full timestamp when app started
- **Current Uptime**: Real-time uptime display
- **Current Time**: Server current time for reference

### Live Updates:
- Uptime increments properly every minute
- Survives page refreshes with accurate time
- Based on server time, not client time

## Technical Implementation

```python
# Server-side calculation
app_start_time = datetime.utcnow()  # Set when module loads
current_time = datetime.utcnow()
uptime_delta = current_time - app_start_time
uptime_hours = int(uptime_delta.total_seconds() // 3600)
uptime_minutes = int((uptime_delta.total_seconds() % 3600) // 60)
```

```javascript
// Client-side live updates
const serverStartTime = new Date('{{ system_info.app_start_time.isoformat() }}Z');
let baseUptimeHours = {{ system_info.uptime_hours }};
// Updates every minute with accurate increments
```

## Verification
✅ Shows real application uptime, not page load time
✅ Persists across page refreshes  
✅ Updates live every minute
✅ Displays start timestamp for reference
✅ Works for short and long uptimes (tested up to 53+ hours)

The system uptime now accurately reflects when the Flask application actually started running!
