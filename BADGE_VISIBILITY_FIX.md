# Badge Visibility Fix Summary

## Problem
Admin panel badges were showing white text on white background, making them invisible.

## Root Cause
The admin templates were using Bootstrap 4 badge syntax (`badge-success`, `badge-danger`, etc.) while the application is using Bootstrap 5.3.0, which uses different badge classes (`bg-success`, `bg-danger`, etc.).

## Solution
Updated all badge classes from Bootstrap 4 to Bootstrap 5 syntax:

### Changes Made:
- `badge-success` → `bg-success`
- `badge-danger` → `bg-danger`
- `badge-warning` → `bg-warning`
- `badge-info` → `bg-info`
- `badge-primary` → `bg-primary`
- `badge-secondary` → `bg-secondary`

### Files Updated:
1. **system.html** - Database status, environment, debug mode badges
2. **database.html** - Submission status badges (Correct/Incorrect/Ungraded)
3. **user_detail.html** - User role badges
4. **users.html** - User role badges in listing
5. **sections.html** - Student enrollment count badges
6. **dashboard.html** - Database status badge

### Templates Already Correct:
- **logs.html** - Already using Bootstrap 5 syntax

## Testing
All badges should now display with proper colors:
- ✅ **Success badges**: Green background with white text
- ✅ **Danger badges**: Red background with white text  
- ✅ **Warning badges**: Yellow background with dark text
- ✅ **Info badges**: Light blue background with white text
- ✅ **Primary badges**: Blue background with white text
- ✅ **Secondary badges**: Gray background with white text

## Verification
Navigate to any admin page and verify that status badges are now visible and properly colored instead of appearing as white text on white background.
