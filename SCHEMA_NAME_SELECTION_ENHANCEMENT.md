# Schema Name Selection Enhancement - Summary

## Issue Fixed
Previously, when teachers had imported schemas, students would see "sql_classroom" as a database option in the SQL playground. This was confusing because "sql_classroom" is the technical database name where schemas are deployed with prefixes, not a user-friendly name.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database List Changes (`app/routes/student.py`)
**Before:**
- Students saw "sql_classroom" when teacher had imported schemas

**After:**
- Students see the actual schema names (e.g., "Student Database", "Course Materials")
- Each schema name appears as a separate database option

### 2. Database Access Logic Enhancement
**New Workflow:**
1. Student selects a schema name from dropdown (e.g., "Student Database")
2. System identifies this as a teacher's imported schema
3. System connects to `sql_classroom` database behind the scenes
4. Queries are automatically rewritten to use the schema's table prefix
5. Results are filtered to show only tables/data from that specific schema

### 3. Query Processing Improvements
**SHOW TABLES Enhancement:**
- When student selects a schema, SHOW TABLES only shows tables from that schema
- Table names are displayed without the prefix (user-friendly)
- Example: Instead of showing `prefix_students`, shows `students`

**Query Rewriting:**
- All queries are automatically rewritten to use the correct table prefixes
- Student writes: `SELECT * FROM students`
- System executes: `SELECT * FROM prefix_students`

### 4. User Experience Improvements
**Database Selection:**
- Clear, descriptive schema names instead of technical "sql_classroom"
- Students can easily identify which schema contains which content
- Multiple schemas appear as separate options

**Error Messages:**
- Updated to show schema names in error messages
- Clear indication of available options

## Code Changes Made

### Modified Files:
1. **`app/routes/student.py`**
   - `get_available_databases()`: Returns schema names instead of "sql_classroom"
   - `playground_execute()`: Enhanced to handle schema name selection
   - Added logic to map schema names to sql_classroom database

2. **`app/templates/student/sql_playground.html`**
   - Updated help text to reflect new behavior

3. **`ALLOWED_DATABASE_FEATURE.md`**
   - Updated documentation to reflect schema name selection

### New Test File:
- **`test_schema_name_selection.py`**: Tests the new schema name functionality

## Example User Experience

### Before:
```
Database dropdown options:
- classicmodels
- sakila  
- sql_classroom  <- confusing technical name
```

### After:
```
Database dropdown options:
- classicmodels
- sakila
- Student Database    <- clear, descriptive name
- Course Materials    <- another schema name
```

### Usage Flow:
1. Student selects "Student Database" from dropdown
2. Student writes: `SHOW TABLES;`
3. System connects to sql_classroom, finds tables with the schema prefix
4. Student sees clean table names: `students`, `courses`, `grades`
5. Student writes: `SELECT * FROM students LIMIT 5;`
6. System rewrites to: `SELECT * FROM schema_prefix_students LIMIT 5;`
7. Student sees results from the correct schema

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Students see meaningful schema names instead of technical database names
2. **Clearer Context**: Each schema appears as a separate "database" option
3. **Automatic Handling**: All technical details (prefixes, rewrites) handled behind the scenes
4. **Isolated Access**: Students only see tables from the selected schema
5. **Maintained Functionality**: All existing features continue to work

## Backward Compatibility

- Existing allowed databases continue to work normally
- Students with assigned databases see no change
- Teachers can still use sql_classroom directly if needed
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

This enhancement makes the SQL playground much more intuitive for students while maintaining all the technical functionality needed for proper schema isolation and security.
